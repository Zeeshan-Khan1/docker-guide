# 🐳 Docker Images

## 🔹 What is a Docker Image?
A **Docker Image** is a **lightweight, standalone, and executable package** that contains everything needed to run a piece of software.  
It works as a **blueprint** for creating containers.

- Think of it like a **template** or a **class in OOP**.
- A container is like an **object created from that class**.

## 🔑 Essentials of a Docker Image

1. **Base OS Layer**  
   - Every image starts with a base (like `ubuntu`, `alpine`, `debian`).  
   - It provides the operating system environment.

2. **Application Code**  
   - Your program or service (Node.js app, Python script, Java app, etc.).

3. **Dependencies & Libraries**  
   - All required packages to make the app run.  
   - Example: `pip install flask` for Python apps.

4. **Configuration**  
   - Exposed ports (`EXPOSE 80`)  
   - Environment variables (`ENV VAR=value`)  
   - Commands to execute (`CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`).

5. **Read-only Nature**  
   - Images are immutable.  
   - Once created, they don’t change.  
   - Containers add a **writable layer** on top when running.

## 🔧 Why are Docker Images Important?
- **Portability** → Runs the same everywhere (Windows, Linux, Cloud).  
- **Reproducibility** → Same setup for all developers.  
- **Speed** → Containers start in seconds from an image.  
- **Efficiency** → One image can run multiple containers.  
- **Sharing** → Easily pushed to Docker Hub or private registries.

## 📌 Example
```bash
# Pull an official Ubuntu image
docker pull ubuntu:20.04

# List available images
docker images

# Run a container from the image
docker run -it ubuntu:20.04 bash
👉 Here, the image ubuntu:20.04 acts as a template, and the container created from it is a running instance.

📝 Summary
Docker Image = Blueprint

Container = Running Instance

Essentials: Base OS + App Code + Dependencies + Configurations

Key Benefit: Build once, run anywhere 🚀
