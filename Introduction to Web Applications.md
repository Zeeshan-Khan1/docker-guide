Definition:
A web application is software that runs on a server and is accessed through a browser (e.g., Gmail, Facebook, or your Blood Donation website).

How it works:

User sends a request via browser (HTTP/HTTPS).

Server processes it (with backend code + database).

Response (HTML/CSS/JS) is sent back to the browser.
