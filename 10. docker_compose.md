# Docker Compose  

Docker Compose is a tool for **defining and managing multi-container applications**.  
Instead of starting containers manually with long `docker run` commands, you can describe your services (containers), networks, and volumes in a single YAML file, then bring everything up with **one command**.

## 36. Introduction to Docker Compose  
- Simplifies working with **multi-container applications**.  
- Uses a **docker-compose.yml** file to configure services.  
- One command (`docker compose up`) can start an entire application stack.

## 37. Installing Docker Compose on Linux  

Install using the official Docker package:  
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin -y


Verify installation:

docker compose version

38. Structure of Docker Compose File

A docker-compose.yml file typically has the following structure:

version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
volumes:
  db_data:


Explanation:

services → Defines containers (web, db).

image → The Docker image to use.

ports → Port mapping between host and container.

environment → Environment variables for the service.

volumes → Persistent data storage.

39. Running WordPress + MySQL with Docker Compose

Example: docker-compose.yml for WordPress and MySQL

version: "3.8"
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_USER: wp_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: wp_pass

  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    restart: always
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wp_user
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wp_pass
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
    depends_on:
      - db

volumes:
  db_data:


Run the application:

docker compose up -d


Visit: http://localhost:8080
 → WordPress should be running.

40. Docker Compose Command Line

Common commands:

Start containers:

docker compose up -d


Stop containers:

docker compose down


View running services:

docker compose ps


View logs:

docker compose logs -f


Scale a service:

docker compose up -d --scale web=3

✅ Key Takeaways

Docker Compose is essential for managing multi-service applications.

It uses a YAML file to define services, networks, and volumes.

With one command, you can bring up or tear down an entire application stack.
