Stages of Containerization

What it means: The process of moving from a traditional app → virtual machines → containers.

Work:

Code → You write your app.

Dependencies → Install libraries.

Dockerfile → Define how to build the image.

Image → Build with docker build.

Container → Run with docker run.

Architecture and Components of Docker
Docker has 3 main parts:

Docker Engine (Daemon) – Runs in background, manages containers.

Docker CLI – Commands you type (docker run, docker ps).

Docker Hub/Registry – Stores/pulls images.

Repo file:

[User] -> [Docker CLI] -> [Docker Daemon] -> [Images & Containers]

A quick look at the format of Dockerfile
Dockerfile is a text file with instructions.

Basic format:

FROM RUN COPY CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

Demo: Dockerfile - Fundamental Instructions
Instructions used:

FROM – base image.

RUN – run a command during image build.

COPY – copy files from host to container.

CMD – command to run when container starts.

Example:

FROM ubuntu:20.04 RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/ CMD ["echo", "Hello from container!"]

Demo: Dockerfile - Configuration Instructions
Instructions used:

ENV – set environment variables.

WORKDIR – set working directory.

USER – specify user.

Example:

FROM ubuntu:20.04 ENV APP_ENV=production WORKDIR /app COPY . /app CMD ["bash"]

Demo: Dockerfile - Expose Instructions
EXPOSE = tells Docker which port the container listens on.

Example:

FROM nginx:latest COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/ EXPOSE 80 CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

Run:

docker build -t my-nginx . docker run -p 8080:80 my-nginx

Note for the upcoming Apache demo
This is just a note folder where you explain:

"We’ll containerize an Apache web server in the next step."

Demo: Containerizing application with Dockerfile
Steps:

Write Dockerfile for Apache or Nginx app.

Build image:

docker build -t my-apache .

Run container:

docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-apache

Open browser → http://localhost:8080.

Example Dockerfile:

FROM httpd:latest COPY ./index.html /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ EXPOSE 80 CMD ["httpd-foreground"]
