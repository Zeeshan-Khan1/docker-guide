# Docker Storage: Never lose a "bit" of your data!  

By default, Docker containers are **ephemeral** â€” meaning all data inside a container is lost once it stops or is removed.  
To persist data and share it between containers or with the host system, Docker provides **Storage Options** such as **Volumes**, **Bind Mounts**, and **tmpfs mounts**.

## 33. Docker Storage and When to Use It  

Docker storage is useful when:  
- You need to **persist data** beyond the containerâ€™s lifecycle.  
- You want to **share data** between multiple containers.  
- You want to **decouple data** from the container image.  

Types of Docker Storage:  
1. **Volumes** â†’ Managed by Docker, stored in Dockerâ€™s data directory.  
2. **Bind Mounts** â†’ Maps a host directory/file directly into a container.  
3. **tmpfs Mounts** â†’ Stores data in memory only (not persistent).  

---

## 34. Working with Volumes  

- **Create a volume**:  
  ```bash
  docker volume create my_volume


List volumes:

docker volume ls


Inspect a volume:

docker volume inspect my_volume


Remove a volume:

docker volume rm my_volume


Remove all unused volumes:

docker volume prune

35. Mounting Volumes to Containers

Volumes are the preferred way to persist data in Docker.
They can be mounted into a container at runtime:

docker run -d \
  --name my_container \
  -v my_volume:/app/data \
  nginx


Here:

my_volume â†’ The Docker-managed volume.

/app/data â†’ The path inside the container where data will be stored.

Any data written to /app/data inside the container will be stored in the persistent volume my_volume.

ðŸ”— Example: Share a Volume Between Containers
# Create and run first container
docker run -d --name c1 -v shared_data:/data busybox

# Run second container with same volume
docker run -it --name c2 -v shared_data:/data busybox sh


Now both containers share /data via the same volume shared_data.

âœ… Key Takeaways

Containers are temporary, but volumes ensure data is persistent.

Volumes are easier to back up and migrate than bind mounts.

Volumes are stored in Docker-managed locations (usually /var/lib/docker/volumes/).

Always use volumes when working with production applications.
