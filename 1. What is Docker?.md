ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that helps developers build, package, and run applications inside containers.

A container is like a lightweight, portable box that has everything your app needs (code, libraries, dependencies).

This makes sure your app runs the same way everywhere â€“ on your PC, server, or cloud.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: If an app works on your laptop but not on a server, Docker fixes this problem.
