Docker Containers

A Docker Container is a lightweight, executable unit that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Containers are portable and isolated from each other, ensuring consistency across different environments.

22. A Container is Born!

A container is created from a Docker Image.

Think of an image as a blueprint, and a container as a running instance of that blueprint.

Command:

docker run <image_name>

23. Run vs Create

docker run → Creates and starts a container immediately.

docker create → Only creates a container but does not start it.

Example:

docker create nginx
docker start <container_id>

24. Start, Stop, and Rename

Start a container:

docker start <container_id>


Stop a running container:

docker stop <container_id>


Rename a container:

docker rename old_name new_name

25. Attach & Execute Commands on a Running Container

Attach to container’s process:

docker attach <container_id>


Execute a command inside a running container:

docker exec -it <container_id> bash

26. Port Mapping on Containers

Port mapping allows you to expose container ports to your host machine.

Example:

docker run -p 8080:80 nginx


(This maps container’s port 80 to host’s port 8080)

27. Erasing Containers

Stop and remove a container:

docker rm <container_id>


Remove all stopped containers:

docker container prune
