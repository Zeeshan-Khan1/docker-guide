Modern applications are rarely built as a single process. Instead, they are made up of multiple services that work together — for example, a web server, a database, and a caching service. In Docker, each of these services can run inside its own container, and they need a way to communicate with each other.

This is where Docker Networking comes in. Docker provides a powerful networking model that allows containers to talk to one another, to the host machine, and to the outside world. It ensures:

Isolation: Containers can be isolated from networks they shouldn’t access.

Flexibility: Different network drivers allow different communication patterns.

Scalability: Multi-container applications can be easily scaled across one or many hosts.

Docker comes with native network drivers and a Container Networking Model (CNM) that define how containers connect, communicate, and share data. Developers can also create and manage custom networks for better control over their applications.

. Multi-container Applications

Applications are often split into multiple containers (e.g., web server + database).

Each container handles a specific responsibility.

Example with docker-compose.yml:

version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root


Here:

web runs an nginx container

db runs a MySQL container

29. Container Networking Model & Docker Network Drivers

Docker provides an abstraction for container communication.

Every container is attached to a network.

Networking models:

Bridge (default) – containers on the same host can talk to each other.

Host – container shares the host’s networking namespace.

Overlay – allows containers across multiple hosts to communicate.

Macvlan – assigns a MAC address to a container, appearing as a physical device.

None – no network connectivity.

30. Docker’s Native Network Drivers

bridge: Default driver. Best for containers on a single host.

host: Removes network isolation, directly using host networking.

overlay: Used for multi-host communication (common in Swarm/Kubernetes).

macvlan: Assigns unique MAC addresses for containers (appears as part of physical network).

none: Completely disables networking for a container.

31. Working with Docker Networks

List available networks:

docker network ls


Create a new network:

docker network create my_network


Run a container and attach it to a network:

docker run -d --network my_network nginx

32. Connect, Disconnect & Inspect Networks

Connect a container to a network:

docker network connect my_network <container_id>


Disconnect a container from a network:

docker network disconnect my_network <container_id>


Inspect a network (see details about connected containers):

docker network inspect my_network
