# 17. Introduction to Docker Images

## What it means:
- Docker Image = a **blueprint** of your application.
- It contains:
  - App code
  - Dependencies
  - Configuration
  - Base OS layer

## How it works:
1. Write a `Dockerfile`.
2. Build an **Image** using `docker build`.
3. Run a **Container** from the Image using `docker run`.

ðŸ”¹ What is Docker Hub?

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry provided by Docker.

It is like GitHub for Docker images.

You can store, share, and download container images there.

ðŸ”¹ Why do we need Docker Hub?

Central Storage â€“ Keep your Docker images in one place (cloud).

Sharing â€“ Anyone can download your images (docker pull).

Ready-made Images â€“ Thousands of official images (MySQL, Ubuntu, Nginx, Apache, etc.) are already available.

CI/CD Integration â€“ Used in automation pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.).

Collaboration â€“ Teams can push/pull images instead of sending files manually.

ðŸ”¹ When do we use it?

âœ… If you want to use existing images (like mysql:latest, nginx:alpine) â†’ you pull from Docker Hub.

âœ… If you build your own image and want others (or servers) to use it â†’ you push to Docker Hub.

âœ… If you deploy apps on different servers â†’ you keep the image on Docker Hub and pull it anywhere.

ðŸ“Œ Analogy:
Think of Docker Hub like Play Store:

Developers upload apps â†’ Docker images (push).

Users download apps â†’ Docker images (pull).

Instead of keeping apps only on your PC, you keep them in the store (Hub) so others can use them too.
Pull image:

bash
Copy code
docker pull ubuntu:20.04
Run container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it ubuntu:20.04 bash
Push image (after login):

bash
Copy code
docker login
docker tag my-app username/my-app:v1
docker push username/my-app:v1

```markdown
# 19. Demo: Working with Docker Images

## Commands:

- **List images:**
  ```bash
  docker images
Search for images:

bash
Copy code
docker search nginx
Pull image:

bash
Copy code
docker pull nginx:latest
Run image:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
Tag image:

bash
Copy code
docker tag nginx my-nginx:v1
Push image:

bash
Copy code
docker push username/my-nginx:v1
Example Flow:
bash
Copy code
docker search alpine
docker pull alpine:latest
docker run -it alpine:latest sh
docker tag alpine username/alpine-test:v1
docker push username/alpine-test:v1
yaml
Copy code

#### `20-Inspect-History
```markdown
# 20. Demo: Know your Docker Image (Inspect & History)

## Inspect an image:
```bash
docker inspect nginx:latest
Shows metadata (layers, env variables, ports, etc.).

View history of an image:
bash
Copy code
docker history nginx:latest
Shows the commands used to build the image.

Example Output:
docker inspect â†’ JSON details

docker history â†’ Layer-by-layer instructions
